### Technical Background

The first time I was exposed to programming was in highschool.  I learned C++ to code some simple robots I made in my engineering class. I then took a web design class where we learned HTML and CSS.  I made my first website in that class and it set me on my computerscience degree path.  In college I have taken Computer science 1 and 2 so I have been learning Python
